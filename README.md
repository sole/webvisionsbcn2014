- active line background change with transition
- why does the web component not work in Firefox?
	- also say webcomponentsenabled needs to be true
	- use <template>?
	- is it possible to place the code mirror dependency inside the component only? Browserify??
- iframes or what happens when changing between slides (+multiple audio contexts, multiple CMs)
- push to upstream the fixes in brickpresso
- brickpresso change slides on page up/down only as option (so arrows can be used to navigate the code)
- probably update the brickpresso (deck) css to a recent version, if applicable

- platform.js
	- html imports
		- code mirror encapsulation?
		- ~~~ brick deck
